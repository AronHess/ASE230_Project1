# REST API Project Presentation 
By Aaron Hesse 
ASE 230 – Project 1 
 
This presentation covers the 10 REST APIs implemented, how they work, and examples of requests and responses. 
 
--- 
## Overview 
 
I implemented 10 REST APIs using PHP/MySQL and JSON. 
Some APIs use Bearer Token authentication for secure data access. 
The APIs included are: Countries, Weather, Pets, Trivia, Users, Dropbox, GitHub, Indeed, NASA, and Spotify. 
 
--- 
## Countries API 
 
Purpose: Provides country information such as capital, population, and region. Useful for applications involving travel, mapping, or geography. 
Endpoints: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE /countries.php 
Data: Stored in MySQL (CRUD operations demonstrated). 
 
--- 
## Countries API – Example 
 
Request (GET): 
 
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/countries.php 
 
Response (JSON): 
 
[ 
  {"id":1,"name":"United States","capital":"Washington D.C.","population":331000000},   {"id":2,"name":"Canada","capital":"Ottawa","population":38000000} 
] 
 
--- 
## Weather API 
 
Purpose: Retrieves current weather conditions for cities. Demonstrates dynamic external data retrieval. 
Endpoints: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE /weather.php 
Data: Demonstrates integration with an external data source. 
 
--- 
## Weather API – Example 
 
Request (GET): 
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/weather.php 
 
Response (JSON): 
 
[ 
  {"id":1,"city":"New York","temperature":22,"condition":"Cloudy"}, 
  {"id":2,"city":"Miami","temperature":30,"condition":"Sunny"} 
] 
 
--- 
## Pets API 
 
Purpose: Manages pet information including name, type, and owner. Demonstrates CRUD operations with MySQL storage. 
Endpoints: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE /pets.php Data: Stored in MySQL. 
 
--- 
## Pets API – Example 
 
Request (GET): 
 
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/pets.php 
 
Response (JSON): 
[ 
  {"id":1,"name":"Bella","kind":"Dog","owner":"Alice Johnson"}, 
  {"id":2,"name":"Luna","kind":"Cat","owner":"Bob Smith"} 
] 
 
--- 
## Trivia API 
 
Purpose: Provides trivia questions and answers. Useful for quiz or educational apps. 
Endpoints: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE /trivia.php 
Data: Stored in JSON (simple data retrieval demonstrated). 
 
--- 
## Trivia API – Example 
 
Request (GET): 
 
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/trivia.php 
 
Response (JSON): 
 
[ 
  {"id":1,"question":"What is the capital of France?","answer":"Paris"}, 
  {"id":2,"question":"Which planet is known as the Red Planet?","answer":"Mars"} 
] 
--- 
## Users API 
 
Purpose: Manages user information such as name, email, and major. Demonstrates CRUD operations for user management. 
Endpoints: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE /users.php Data: Stored in MySQL. 
 
--- 
## Users API – Example 
 
Request (GET): 
 
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/users.php 
 
Response (JSON): 
 
[ 
  {"id":1,"name":"Alice Johnson","email":"alice.johnson@university.edu"},   {"id":2,"name":"Bob Smith","email":"bob.smith@university.edu"} 
] 
 
--- 
## Dropbox API (Bearer Token) 
 
Purpose: Manages files and folders in Dropbox securely. Demonstrates secure API access using Bearer Tokens. 
Endpoints: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE /dropbox.php 
Security: Requires Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN> header. 
 
--- 
## Dropbox API – Example 
 
Request (GET): 
 
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer DROPBOXTOKEN98765" http://localhost:8000/dropbox.php 
 
Response (JSON):

  {"id":2,"filename":"project.zip","size":"120MB"} 
] 
 
--- 
## GitHub API 
 
Purpose: Retrieves repository information securely. Demonstrates secure access to external services using Bearer Tokens. 
Endpoints: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE /github.php 
Security: Requires Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN> header. 
 
--- 
## GitHub API – Example 
 
Request (GET): 
 
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer GITHUBTOKEN12345" http://localhost:8000/github.php 
 
Response (JSON): 
 
[ 
  {"id":1,"repo":"api_project","language":"PHP"}, 
  {"id":2,"repo":"portfolio-site","language":"JavaScript"} 
] 
 
--- 
## Indeed API 
 
Purpose: Provides job listings and company information. Useful for displaying real-time job postings.

[ 
  {"id":1,"position":"Software Engineer","company":"TechCorp","location":"New York"}, 
  {"id":2,"position":"Network Security Analyst","company":"SecureNet","location":"Chicago"} 
] 
 
--- 
## NASA API (Bearer Token) 
 
Purpose: Provides astronomy data (e.g., Astronomy Picture of the Day). Demonstrates integration with scientific APIs using Bearer Tokens. 
Endpoints: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE /nasa.php 
Security: Requires Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN> header. 
 
--- 
## NASA API – Example 
 
Request (GET):

# Project Summary 
 
This project included 10 REST APIs, 2 of which required Bearer Token authentication. 
All CRUD operations were implemented and tested with .sh scripts and test.html. 
Data was stored in both JSON and MySQL, demonstrating full database integration.
